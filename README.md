### OpenTourism is a map based platform that uses curated google maps locations to make tourism site discovery far faster. Maps also encourages users to interact more and possibly discover additional locations or activities to visit during a trip.

### With good SEO OpenTourism (open source flask app) can become the top result for related terms. It's lighweight and easy to exit (through google maps) for community groups or goverments.

### Ideally hosted and suppored by local government's economic development offices. Local tourism operations can also submit their google business listing to be added to the app, and updated to google listings will be reflected in the app.
