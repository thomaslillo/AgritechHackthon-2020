# AgritechHack 2020

## Category: Agritourism & Sustainability

### Problem Statement: Tourism attraction information is not super accessible and usually presented in text format. Search results do not effectivly connect search terms and other agri tourism operations for searchers to find.

### Search results for apple picking lead to information overload and poor resources for planning a trip that involves more than one activity.

### If you just look for apple picking, its unlikely you'll discover other potential destinations during your search.

### OpenTourism is a map based platform that uses curated google maps locations to make tourism site discovery far faster. Maps provide more detailed spatial context so searchers can discover additional locations or activities to visit during a trip they may not have previously considered.

### With good SEO OpenTourism can become the top result for related terms. It's cheap to set up and easy to edit (through google maps) for community groups or goverments.

### Ideally hosted and suppored by local government's economic development offices. Local tourism operations can also submit their google business listing to be added to the app, and updated to google listings will be reflected in the app.

## Tech Used
- Flask (Python)
- Google Maps API
- Could be hosted on a low cloud provider or on a local server
